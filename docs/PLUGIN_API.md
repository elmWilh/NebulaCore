# Plugin API (Deprecated Location)

Plugin API documentation was moved.

Use:

- `docs/PLUGIN_MANAGER_API.md` for Plugin Manager HTTP API, runtime model, states, scopes, and plugin developer guide.
- `docs/CORE_INSTALL_API.md` for install/bootstrap and service automation API.

This file is kept only as a compatibility pointer.
